## **Framework Architecture**

The framework is divided into **7 key layers**, each performing a specific function in the system:

1. **Layer-1: Data Curation** 📊  
   Collects and integrates both **public** and **private datasets** into a unified data repository.

2. **Layer-2: SynerTrain Pipeline Augmentation** 🧑‍🏫  
   Trains **ensemble models** and performs data augmentation tasks such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and feature integration.

3. **Layer-3: LangAima IntraChain Framework** 🔗  
   Integrates external components and pre-trains models for enhanced performance in real-time activity monitoring and external system integration.

4. **Layer-4: ChainTrust Content Validator** ✔️  
   Validates the **authenticity** and **integrity** of data, ensuring it is trustworthy before processing.

5. **Layer-5: LanGaima Swarm Intelligence Model** 🐝  
   Uses **decentralized agent-based communities** to detect threats autonomously and in parallel.

6. **Layer-6: Classification Model** 🏷️  
   Classifies **events**, **activities**, and **actions** using advanced AI models (Crew AI, Transformer, and LLaMA).

7. **Layer-7: Fine-Tuning** ⚙️  
   Fine-tunes the model based on classified results to continuously improve its ability to mitigate new threats.
