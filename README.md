## **Framework Architecture**

The framework is divided into **7 key layers**, each performing a specific function in the system:

1. **Layer-1: Data Curation**
   - Loads and combines public and private datasets to form a hybrid data repository.

2. **Layer-2: SynerTrain Pipeline Augmentation**
   - Trains ensemble models on curated data and performs augmentation tasks such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and feature integration.

3. **Layer-3: LangAima IntraChain Framework**
   - Integrates external components and pretrains the models to enhance system flexibility and performance.

4. **Layer-4: ChainTrust Content Validator**
   - Validates the authenticity and integrity of processed data to prevent malicious content.

5. **Layer-5: LanGaima Swarm Intelligence Model**
   - Uses decentralized agent-based communities to detect threats in real-time.

6. **Layer-6: Classification Model**
   - Classifies events, activities, and actions using AI models like Crew AI, Transformer, and LLaMA.

7. **Layer-7: Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tunes the model to continuously improve its ability to detect and mitigate cyber threats.
